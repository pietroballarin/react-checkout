# React checkout application

This is a small application built with **React.js** and hooks that replicates a checkout process for a cloud storage service. 

The selection of different subscription options updates the overview of the chosen plan at the bottom of the page.

It uses validation for the credit card details and the email address of the customer.

The web app has been built considering a **mobile-first** approach.
